## [v1.5.0] - 2019-08-26

### BREAKING CHANGES

- You must be using Cumulus API version >= v1.14.0 in order to use the new
  distribution metrics functionality.

### Added

- **CUMULUS-1337**
  - Must use Cumulus API version v1.14.0 or above in order to use the newi
    distribution metrics functionality.
  - Distribution metrics are no longer served from the Cumulus API, but are
    computed from the logs in an ELK stack.
  - If you want to display distribution metrics using a Kibana instance (ELK
    stack), you need to set the environment variables `KIBANAROOT` to point to
    the base url of an accessible Kibana instance as well as `ESROOT` to the
    Elastic Search endpoint holding your metrics.
  - The `KIBANAROOT` will be used to generate links to the kibana discovery page
    to interrogate errors/successes further.
  - The `ESROOT` is used to query Elasticsearch directly to retrieve the
    displayed counts.
  - For information on setting up the Cumulus Distribution API Logs and S3
    Server Access see the [Cumulus Distribution Metrics documentation].
  - See this project's `README.md` for instructions on setting up development
    access for Kibana and Elasticsearch.
